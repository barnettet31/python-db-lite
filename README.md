# The Purpose

Purpose of this project was to practice with sqlite and writing sql commands and get refreshed on it.

# The project

Project has a few objectives:

- Use a local SQL database to manage inventory via a command line tool
- Create on or multiple inventory items
- Update existing inventory items
- Read one specific item or multiple items
- Delete items that exist

# What I learned

In this project I mostly reviewed basic crud operations and how to write sql commands in python and use a local database to manage content and persist data over subsequent runs of a program. Python is a simple language and fun to use.

# Errors

- If you do not create the item element correctly then you will receive an error printed in the console that informs you of what property type you've formatted incorrectly and why
- If you attempt to create an item that exists you will get a notification that it already exists and that your number has been added to the already existing list of that item
- If you attempt to delete an item you will get a message stating "That item does not exist!" and then it will continue

# How to run

Pull the code from the repository and ensure python 3 is install on your device. Then run the main.py file from the directory.
